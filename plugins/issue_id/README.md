# Redmine ISSUE-id Plugin

The ISSUE-id plugin adds support for a new style of issue IDs to [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org).
With this plugin issue IDs can consist of a special project key (e.g., `ISSUE`) and a per-project issue number (which starts from 1 for each project).
In other words, issue IDs can look like `#ISSUE-1`, `#ISSUE-2`, `#ISSUE-3` and so on.

For more information check [the project page](http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/project/redmine/issue-id) of the plugin.
If you found any issues, report them [here](http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/projects/issue-id/issues).
